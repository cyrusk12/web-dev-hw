     <p>The year that Buttercup was born, the most beautiful woman in the world
        was a French scullery maid named Annette. Annette worked in Paris for
        the Duke and Duchess de Guiche, and it did not escape the Duke's notice
        that someone extraordinary was polishing the pewter. The Duke's notice
        did not escape the notice of the Duchess either, who was not very
        beautiful and not very rich, but plenty smart. The Duchess set about
        studying Annette and shortly found her adversary's tragic flaw.

        Chocolate.
      </br>
        Armed now, the Duchess set to work. The Palace de Guiche turned into a
        candy castle. Everywhere you looked, bonbons. There were piles of
        chocolate-covered mints in the drawing rooms, baskets of
        chocolate-covered nougats in the parlors.

    <p>Armed now, the Duchess set to work. The Palace de Guiche turned into a
       candy castle. Everywhere you looked, bonbons. There were piles of
       chocolate-covered mints in the drawing rooms, baskets of
       chocolate-covered nougats in the parlors.

       Annette never had a chance. Inside a season, she went from delicate to whopping,
       and the Duke never glanced in her direction without sad bewilderment clouding
       his eyes. (Annette, it might be noted, seemed only cheerier throughout her
       enlargement. She eventually married the pastry chef and they both ate a lot
       until old age claimed them. Things, it might also be noted, did not fare so
       cheerily for the Duchess. The Duke, for reasons passing understanding, next
       became smitten with his very own mother-in-law, which caused the Duchess
       ulcers, only they didn't have ulcers yet. More precisely, ulcers existed,
       people had them, but they weren't called "ulcers." The medical profession at
       that time called them "stomach pains" and felt the best cure was coffee
       dolloped with brandy twice a day until the pains subsided. The Duchess took
       her mixture faithfully, watching through the years as her husband and her mother
       blew kisses at each other behind her back. Not surprisingly, the Duchess's
       grumpiness became legendary, as Voltaire has so ably chronicled.
       (Except this was before Voltaire.)

       The year Buttercup turned ten, the most beautiful woman lived in Bengal, the
       daughter of a successful tea merchant. This girl's name was Aluthra, and her
       skin was of a dusky perfection unseen in India for eighty years.
       (There have only been eleven perfect complexions in all of India since
       accurate accounting began.) Aluthra was nineteen the year the pox plague
       hit Bengal. The girl survived, even if her skin did not.

       When Buttercup was fifteen, Adela Terrell, of Sussex on the Thames, was easily
       the most beautiful creature. Adela was twenty, and so far did she outdistance
       the world that it seemed certain she would be the most beautiful for many,
       many years. But then one day, one of her suitors (she had 104 of them)
       exclaimed that without question Adela must be the most ideal item yet spawned.
       Adela, flattered, began to ponder on the truth of the statement. That night,
       alone in her room, she examined herself pore by pore in her mirror.
       (This was after mirrors.) It took her until close to dawn to finish her
       inspection, but by that time it was clear to her that the young man had been
       quite correct in his assessment: she was, through no real fault of her own,
       perfect.
