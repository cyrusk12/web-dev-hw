# Technical Report
1. For this assignment I had to spend a lot of tome on figuring out how t use fonts and then ended up not being able to figure it out. I have no idea why my fonts don't work.
2. I chose some pretty generic fonts, in terms of when I design stuff like this I like things that are simple and easy to look at and read.
3. The importance of having a fallback font is that many browswers do not support some of the fonts so in order to ensure readabilit it is necessary to have fallback fonts.
