# Technical Report AS5
1. Divs are elements in HTML that help with formatting and make code easier to read. The span element is the in-line equivalent of the div. It allows us to be more specific in certain areas. Ids simply define what the line of code refers to. It's a descriptor.
2. Third party is cheaper and it allows for less errors. Self-hosted media in some cases may not be visible to the user.
3. Working through this assignment was great, it was a little picky at times since formatting is a little hard. For example, when I was finishing the page I had a really hard time getting the title to be centered.
