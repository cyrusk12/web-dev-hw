# Technical Report

The browsers I usually surf are Google Chrome and occasionally Safari depending
on the browsers' capabilities.

I haven't had any experience with the Wayback Machine until now and I
went to a site that is the original atari.com site which was very interesting
considering how ancient that company is now.

Problems/Work Cycle
I had a couple problems with linking images so that took me a while to figure
but once I did everything went fine. To solve the image issue I used the full path of the images.
I kind of did everything out of order as well. I started with the index.html and then went and did the
about.html. I didn't post any of the issues I had as I was able to figure them out myself. I didn't help anyone either.
