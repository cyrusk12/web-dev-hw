<pre>
Don't slow down Johnny,
Keep the Cadillac running
You're so mean, honey
6 street running deadbeat in the pocket
Don't slow down Johnny,
Keep the Cadillac running
We're gonna roll out Johnny
6 street running deadbeat in the pocket
<br />
Let's go, in your line
Hope to give you time
Now if I'd just lie with you
Got music in your mind
Since the verve lost time
The old man show 12 about you
