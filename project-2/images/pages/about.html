  <h1> Why this topic?</h1>
  <p> I chose to share this thopic because I have always wanted to learn
    how to make music with a computer. I did no have access to the spwftware
    for a ling time so it was difficult for me to learn. I then took a music
    class here at the University and this helped me put time into learing it.
    It also helped that it was for a credit because otherwise I probably would
    not have had time to do it.
