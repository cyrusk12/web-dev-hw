  <h1> What is Ableton? </h1>
  <div id="What is Ableton?">
    <p> <i>Ableton</i> is a program where you can edit audio files and arrange
      them however you want. These programs are called <abbr><title="Digital Audio Interface">DAWs</abbr> or <i>Digital Audio Workstation</i>
      They provide music producers ways to make music without ever having to have an
      intrument.
    </br>
      If you want you can also plug in almost any instrument into your computer as lomg as
      you have the right adapters/dongles.

    <h1>What you need...</h1>
    <p> Ableton is a pretty <b>CPU intense program</b> which means it will work your
      computer pretty hard. If you don't have the proper equipment you're going
      to have a very hard time. This is what I would suggest when using ableton:

  <div id="The Basics of Ableton">
    <h1>The Basiscs of Ableton</h1>
    <p> Ableton is a pretty <b>tough program</b> to figure out when you intitially
      look at because everything is so small and the interface is super big.
      Ableton is mainly used for live performances which are concerts where DJs
      stand at a table and have their computer plugged into a bunch of
      different mechanisms, intruments, and devices.
    </br>
    <blockquote>
    Ableton can also be used for <i>arragements</i>. This is what people use for
    putting all of their recordings into different places so that they can make
    a song out of it. You then export the song and it <i>normalizes</i> the song
    which means that it makes it so the song doesn't go over the level of volume that
    that makes it sounds distorted.

  <div id="Conclusions and Cool Stuff">
      <h1>Conclusions and Cool Stuff</h1>
    <p>
    With Ableton you can do so much, the possibilities are endless, you just have
    to know how to use all of the different elements properly. If you want to give
    it a try there is a <q>lite</q> version that is relatively cheap since the
    whole full version is upwards of $300.
  </br>
    COOL STUFF
    Ableton is awesome since some of the stuff is pretty simple. One thing you could
    try is making a drum rack.
    1. Drag a drum rack into the specified track
    2. Go to 'sounds' and drag the sounds you want into the drum rack spots.
    3. Now on your keyboard you can play the drums on the middle line of your keys.
