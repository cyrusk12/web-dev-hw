# Technical Report
1. It was difficult for me to figure out the navigation part of the website,
but once I got it, it became very easy. I think the toughest thing for me are the forms. I don't really understand them very well.
2. I'm excited! I'm also anxious though since I've never done it before, but it sounds very exciting
3. This assignment was good it made me think more about what I was doing rather than jut going through the motions.
