# Technical Report
1. For this assignment I had to spend a lot of tome on fgurung out how t use fnts and then ended up not being able to figure it out. I have no idea why y fonts don't work
2. A form that I have come across a lot of is a form that is made by google. The people I worked for back at home would use these forms to have all of their employees fill out the respective times they could work. Forms have purposes that include a number of things most common of which are login credentials and things like signing up for a website.
3. This assignment wasn't the most difficult thing to do it was just a matter of learning all of the new material so that I could properly do each part of the assignment.
